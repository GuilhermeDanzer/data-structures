# Data Structures Visualizer

A web application built with Next.js to visually demonstrate various data structures in an interactive manner. The primary aim of this project is to provide a visual representation of data structures to aid in understanding their concepts and operations.

## Introduction

Understanding data structures is fundamental for every programmer, as they form the backbone of efficient algorithms and software design. However, comprehending abstract data structures solely through theoretical descriptions can be challenging for many learners. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing an interactive visualization of data structures, starting with the Linked List.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: View the Linked List data structure in a graphical format, with interactive elements to add, remove, and manipulate nodes.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Utilizing React Spring animations, the linked list updates dynamically upon user actions, providing real-time feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive user interface designed for ease of use, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.
- **Expandable Architecture**: Built on Next.js, the project architecture allows for easy integration of additional data structures in the future.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeDanzer/data-structures-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-scrutures-visualizer
   ```
3. To install the depedencies run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
### Running the Application

Start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
   ```
Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a graphical representation of the Linked List.
Use the provided buttons to add new nodes, delete nodes, or perform other operations on the Linked List.
Watch the visualization update in real-time to reflect the changes made.
